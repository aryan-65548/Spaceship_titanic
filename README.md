#  Spaceship Titanic – Kaggle Machine Learning Project

This repository contains my solution to the **Spaceship Titanic** classification problem from Kaggle.  
The goal of the project is to predict whether a passenger was **transported to another dimension** after a spacetime anomaly based on passenger and onboard service data.

##  Problem Overview

In the year 2912, the Spaceship Titanic collided with a spacetime anomaly. As a result, some passengers were transported to another dimension.

 **Objective**:  
Build a machine learning model that predicts the `Transported` status (`True` / `False`) for each passenger.

 **ML Type**:  
- Supervised Learning  
- Binary Classification  

 **Evaluation Metric**:  
- Accuracy
